Welcome to the AI Summer School Day 2.

Yesterday you learned about:

- reading in various types of data
- importing packages and setting up environments (we probably glossed over this a bit, which is for the best for now!)
- some of the ways that using using an integrated development environment like Spyder can help you
- calculating a few operations, and using variables to save results
- how programs can be made more efficient and readable by storing data in arrays or vectors
- flow control with `if` statements and `for` loops
- organising your code into functions

That sounds like a busy day!

Today we'll build on that by looking at how to analyse and manipulate data, using a popular Python package called `pandas`. We will aim to cover:

- key concepts in  `pandas`: data types, syntax and some useful basic functions
- reading in spreadsheets and CSVs
- managing different types of data (categorical and continuous)
- how to quickly calculate simple statistics
- data cleaning and manipulation
- basic data visualisation

## What is `pandas`?

> **pandas** is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.

Pandas provides a set of data structures and methods that can make working with data easier - particularly data that fits in a table or matrix, like a CSV or a spreadsheet. It is, as the quote says, powerful and flexible; it is also commensurately large and complicated. We'll learn a few of the things you can do with it.

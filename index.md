Welcome to the AI Summer School Day 2.

Yesterday you learned about:

- reading in various types of data
- importing packages and setting up environments (we probably glossed over this a bit, which is for the best for now!)
- some of the ways that using using an integrated development environment like Spyder can help you
- calculating a few operations, and using variables to save results
- how programs can be made more efficient and readable by storing data in arrays or vectors
- flow control with `if` statements and `for` loops
- organising your code into functions

Today we'll build on that by looking at how to analyse and manipulate data, using a popular Python package called `pandas`. We will aim to cover:

- key concepts in  `pandas`: data types, syntax and some useful basic functions
- reading in spreadsheets and CSVs
- managing different types of data (categorical and continuous)
- how to quickly calculate simple statistics
- data cleaning and manipulation
- basic data visualisation

## Downloading the datasets

You can download the datasets we'll be using in some of the coming episodes here

- Gapminder GDP data: [python-novice-gapminder-data.zip](data/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip)
- Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2023: we recommend viewing and downloading from source on Google Docs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ioUjhnz6ywSpEbARI-G3RoPyO0NRBqrJnWf-7C_eirs/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1854892322#gid=1854892322). If you have problems, you can find a CSV here: [salary_survey_2023.csv](data/salary_survey_2023.csv)
